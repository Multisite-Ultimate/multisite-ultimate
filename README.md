## Common Installation Issues

**"Failed opening required [...]/vendor/autoload_packages.php"**

This error occurs when the required vendor files are missing. This typically happens when:
- You've downloaded the repository directly from GitHub without using a release package
- The composer dependencies haven't been installed

Solution: Use the pre-packaged release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/superdav42/wp-multisite-waas/releases) or run `composer install` in the plugin directory.

**"Cannot declare class ComposerAutoloaderInitWPUltimoDependencies, because the name is already in use"**

This error usually occurs when updating from an older version of WP Ultimo or when multiple versions of the plugin are installed.

Solution: Deactivate and remove any older versions of WP Ultimo or WP Multisite WaaS before activating the new version.

**"Class 'WP_Ultimo\Database\Sites\Site_Query' not found"**

This error can occur if the plugin's autoloader isn't properly loading all the necessary classes.

Solution: Use the pre-packaged release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/superdav42/wp-multisite-waas/releases) which includes all required files.
