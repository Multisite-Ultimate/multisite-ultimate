# Installing WP Ultimo (v2)

_**IMPORTANT NOTE: This article refers to WP Ultimo version 2.x.**_

_**NOTE:** This tutorial assumes that you already have your WordPress Multisite installed and configured. To see how you can install and configure WP Multisite, take a look at_ [_this tutorial_](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/multisite/) _by WP Beginner._

The time has come!

You finally have everything you need to get started building your online business with WordPress Multisite and WP Ultimo.

Now, how do you install WP Ultimo?

## Getting the plugin's .zip file

After finishing your WP Ultimo purchase, you will receive an email with the .zip file of our plugin and your license key.

Keep in mind this download link expires after some time, so if you want to download WP Ultimo after the link expires, you would need to do it by signing into your [Freemius account](https://help.wpultimo.com/article/282-how-can-i-access-my-account-page-for-the-first-time) and downloading it from there.

Remember to also have your **license key** ready, since you will need it to activate WP Ultimo.

### Where to find your license key

You can find your License key on the email you received after the purchase and inside your Freemius account. Just click on the Licenses tab and your license will be shown there.
