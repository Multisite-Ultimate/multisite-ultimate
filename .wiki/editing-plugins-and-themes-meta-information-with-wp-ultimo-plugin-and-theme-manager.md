# Editing Plugins and Themes Meta Information with WP Ultimo: Plugin and Theme Manager

WP Ultimo: Plugin and Theme Manager is a powerful **premium** WP Ultimo add-on that gives you full control over the way your network users see and interact with the plugin and theme options on your network.

This add-on serves three purposes:

  1. It lets you completely change the metadata of both plugins and themes. That includes name, description, author name, and even thumbnails!

  2. It lets you categorize plugins and themes, to allow your users to easily sort them out.

  3. It gives you the option to replace the old, boring plugins page with a new themes-like page with sorting by categories.

After downloading and installing it, a new tab - _Add-on Settings_ \- will show on WP Ultimo Settings page.

On your network _Plugins_ page you will now be able to edit all the plugins' meta information, such as name, author, and even the plugin's thumbnail.
