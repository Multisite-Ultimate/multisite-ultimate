# Understanding your Dashboard (v2)

_**IMPORTANT NOTE: This article refers to Multisite Ultimate version 2.x.**_

Multisite Ultimate v2 has a dedicated **Dashboard** under the Multisite Ultimate menu, but it also adds some sections to the Network Dashboard. This article will explain the sections you will see both on the Network and the Multisite Ultimate Dashboards.

## The Network Dashboard:

Multisite Ultimate injects a few useful widgets into the network-level dashboard. This dashboard is found by navigating to **My Sites > Network Admin > Dashboard**. The widgets are designed to provide easy access to information and common operations for the network administrator. This is how the network dashboard should look:

Now, let's take a look at each widget of the network dashboard:

**First Steps:** This widget predominantly appears on a fresh installation of Multisite Ultimate such as ours and reminds the network administrator to complete additional tasks, like configuring a payment method and create a test account.

**Summary:** The summary widget reports the number of signups and the revenue for the day. The MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) indicates a projected total across customers with revenue-generating memberships.

**Activity Stream:** This widget reports on events across Multisite Ultimate for which there is a variety to report on. Events could include aspects such as signups, cancellations, creations, and deletions of sites and other activities.

## **The Multisite Ultimate Dashboard:**

While the network dashboard presents holistic information about the network, the Multisite Ultimate dashboard located at the top-level of the Multisite Ultimate menu presents information about the service.

#### Welcome Tour:

On a fresh installation of Multisite Ultimate v2 a brief welcome tour is displayed familiarizing the network administrator with the dashboard and its new functions.

**Documentation:** At the top of the dashboard lies the **Documentation** link. The documentation (this documentation) contains a wealth of information regarding the installation, operation, support, and maintenance of Multisite Ultimate as well as ancillary information designed to be helpful to the network administrator.

The documentation link is prevalent on most Multisite Ultimate pages providing contextual help when called upon. Thus when working with sites, for example, the documentation link will provide help related to the creation and management of network sites.

**Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth:** Leading from the network-level widget the MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) displays a monthly breakdown of revenue over a 12 month calendar period. New revenue is shown in blue while cancellations, in red.

**Date-range Support:** Depending on the number of customers, activity, and type of information statistics soon become overwhelming, difficult to find, and difficult to interpret. The date-range support built into the dashboard allows the network administrator to focus on only the information and information period required.

The date range governs the period of the information displayed by the widgets directly below.

**Revenue:** The total revenue for the period. MRR stands for Monthly Recurring Revenue. You also have a detailed description of the revenue per product.

**New Memberships:** How many new memberships were created on your network for the period you have selected.

**Signups by Countries:** An overview of how many users signed up to your network are on each country.

**Signups by Forms:** On this section you can see how many customers signed up to your network using your main checkout form - and any other checkout form that you have - and how many were added by the super admin(s) of the network.

**Most Visited Sites:** The most visited websites of your network. To make this function work, you need to enable the visit counting function at **Multisite Ultimate > Settings > Sites > Enable Visits Limitation and Counting**.
