# Customizing your Admin Panel with Material WP

WordPress admin interface has been the same for ages. But have you ever wondered how a Material Design version of the admin interface would look like?

Material WP is an admin theme developed to give you that look and feeling, helping you to provide your clients with a more customized Dashboard. Material WP is also part of WP Ultimo’s premium plugins core.

After [installing it](https://help.wpultimo.com/faq/where-can-i-download-the-add-ons), go to your _Plugins_ page and click to activate it on your Network.
