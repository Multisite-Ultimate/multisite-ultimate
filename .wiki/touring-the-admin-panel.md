# Touring the Admin Panel

## The WP Ultimo Grand Tour

The Ultimate WaaS Solution.

WP Ultimo aims to be as simple and self-explanatory as possible, but when you have a tool that does as much as ours do, it might be overwhelming to learn how to navigate the plugin options and admin pages on your own.

In this lesson, we'll have a tour of the WP Ultimo admin pages to help you get situated. We'll also cover particular pages of interest when getting started and teach you how to use _The Jumper_ to get around faster.

## Dashboard

WP Ultimo _Dashboard_ will show you some basic reports and analytics. This includes revenues, site activities like which product is selling, how many new memberships your site is getting, the number of site visitors, and its location.

## Checkout Forms

The _Checkout Forms_ will give you the flexibility you need to create custom registration pages. You can customize and pick the fields and information you wish to collect from your users. You can also insert custom classes and custom scripts within your form as well as put restrictions based on visitor or user country or location.

## Customers

The _Customers_ page will show the list of members registered in your network. This page displays basic user information including name and email address, last login, and also a "switch to" link that will allow you to log in to the user's subsite as a site administrator instead of a super admin account.

## Sites

_Sites_ page contains the complete list of subsites within your network. This includes the "site templates" and subsites owned by customers or members of your network. You can easily access and manage subsites details like mapped domains, limits & quotas, plugins and themes, and site thumbnail.

## Domains

The _Domains_ page is dedicated to custom domains or mapped domains associated with subsites within your network. As a super admin, you have an option to manually add or map custom domain names from here. You can edit or view specific details of each domain from here like DNS records and logs

## Discount Codes

_Discount Codes_ are basically coupon codes should you wish to offer discounts to your end-users. You can create a coupon code from here and specify the desired discount value you want to issue to a specific or a group of users.

## Broadcasts

_Broadcasts_ is a useful tool for super admin in rolling out announcements or sending private messages to your subsite users. You can target specific user groups based on the plan or product they are subscribed under.

## Events

The _Events_ page keeps a record of all the events and logs happening within your entire network. It tracks different activities happening in your multisite, like plan changes. This is super useful in helping you monitor different movements or changes.

## Webhooks

This section is for advanced users as webhooks are commonly used to deliver data to another application. This is useful should you need to send data from WP Ultimo to another platform like Zapier.
