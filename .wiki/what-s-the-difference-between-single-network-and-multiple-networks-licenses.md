# What's the difference between Single Network and Multiple Networks Licenses?

Once you have decided to build your own Website as a Service business, it's time to decide which kind of license fits your needs.

WP Ultimo offers **four kinds** of plans:

  * Starter: 1 network - $247 (per year) - Free add-ons included

  * Plus: 1 network - $347 (per year) - Premium and Free add-ons included

  * Pro: 5 networks - $597 (per year) - Premium and Free add-ons included

  * Agency: Unlimited networks - $997 (one time) - Premium and Free add-ons included

But what is the difference between them? Well, the biggest one lies in how many networks you will be allowed to have.

One network corresponds to one **WordPress install with Multisite enabled** , though the number of sub-sites or sub-domains does not matter.

Our Starter and Plus licenses allow you to use WP Ultimo in one, and only one, network. With our Pro license, you can use the plugin in five WordPress installs with Multisite enabled.

On the other hand, our Agency license offers unlimited networks. This allows you to have **as many networks as you wish**. For example, you can set up different businesses running on different WordPress Multisite installs.

We also have two options of Lifetime packages that grant you lifetime updates and 3 years of support.

  * Single Network - $997 (one-time)

  * 3-network pack - $1997 (one-time)
