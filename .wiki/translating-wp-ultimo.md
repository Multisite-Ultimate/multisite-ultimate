# Translating WP Ultimo

WP Ultimo’s code is developed in English, but the plugin and its add-ons ship with the necessary files (.pot) to allow you to easily translate them to your native language.

In this article, we will cover how you can translate your copy of WP Ultimo for yourself, and how you can help the community by sharing your translations!

## Translating WP Ultimo online

WP Ultimo offers an online tool that allows you to translate WP Ultimo and its add-on while collaborating with other translators at the same time. This platform is hosted at <https://translate.nextpress.co>, and it is shared by all the other products by NextPress.

### Creating an Account on translate.nextpress.co

To be able to translate WP Ultimo you’ll need an account on the translation platform. To create a new account, simply click on the **Register** link at the top-right corner of the page.

_Click the Register Link_

After that, fill out the registration form and you’ll be ready to go!

### Using the Platform

After creating your account, you’ll be redirected to the **translation platform**. Our platform uses Glotpress, the same plugin WordPress uses to translate the plugins on the official plugin repository.

Once logged in, you’ll see a list of the active projects on the platform:

_All the add-ons are also present on the translation platform_

Click the WP Ultimo project (or any of the add-ons) to see the available languages and the progress on each of them.

_Help keep translations up to date!_

In this example, let’s suppose we want to help complete the Brazilian Portuguese translation, which stands at 42% completion. Clicking that language will take you to the actual translation interface.

**Note** : _If your desired language does not appear on that panel, please contact us on support (at) wpultimo.com requesting the inclusion of that language. In the meantime, check the “Translate WP Ultimo locally” sections below to start working on your translation right away._

You can then click on the **Untranslated** link to see all the strings left to be translated and start working on your translation.

_Select the Untranslated Strings_

_**Note** : Your translations will be added as suggestions at first, but our team will be checking them periodically in order to make them acceptable. If you wish to become a_ _**validator**_ _(a person who checks other people’s translations and can enter their own translations without validation) contact us on support (at) wpultimo.com with that request._

## Translating WP Ultimo locally

If you are in a hurry to translate WP Ultimo for your own project right now and can’t wait for the approval process on the online platform, there are other options available:

### Use Poedit to translate the .pot file

You can download and use a desktop application called **Poedit** , which allows you to import .pot files and translate them directly on their interface. In the end, Poedit will generate a .po and .mo file, which you’ll need to place inside the _lang_ folder inside _wp-ultimo (wp-content/plugins/wp-ultimo/lang)_. The .pot file is also contained inside the lang folder.

### Using Loco Translate to translate WP Ultimo

If you don’t want to have the hassle of installing a desktop application and copying and pasting files to your server, you can translate WP Ultimo directly from the admin panel using another WordPress plugin called **Loco Translate**.

Loco optimizes the entire workflow, adding a translation screen inside your WP Admin. There you can create a new translation set and Loco will compile the .po and .mo files for you.

### Contributing your local translations

If you end up using any of the two local methods of translation mentioned above, please consider sharing that work with the rest of the community! WP Ultimo is being used by thousands of users all around the world and chances are there’s someone that speaks the same language as you in need of that translation!

If you want to contribute your translation, send an email with the .po to _**support (at) wpultimo.com**_.
