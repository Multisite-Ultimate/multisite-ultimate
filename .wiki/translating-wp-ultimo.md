# Translating WP Multisite WaaS

WP Multisite WaaS's code is developed in English, but the plugin and its add-ons ship with the necessary files (.pot) to allow you to easily translate them to your native language.

In this article, we will cover how you can translate your copy of WP Multisite WaaS for yourself.

## Translating WP Multisite WaaS locally

If you want to translate WP Multisite WaaS for your own project, there are several options available:

### Use Poedit to translate the .pot file

You can download and use a desktop application called **Poedit** , which allows you to import .pot files and translate them directly on their interface. In the end, Poedit will generate a .po and .mo file, which you'll need to place inside the _lang_ folder inside _wp-ultimo (wp-content/plugins/wp-ultimo/lang)_. The .pot file is also contained inside the lang folder.

### Using Loco Translate to translate WP Multisite WaaS

If you don't want to have the hassle of installing a desktop application and copying and pasting files to your server, you can translate WP Multisite WaaS directly from the admin panel using another WordPress plugin called **Loco Translate**.

Loco optimizes the entire workflow, adding a translation screen inside your WP Admin. There you can create a new translation set and Loco will compile the .po and .mo files for you.
