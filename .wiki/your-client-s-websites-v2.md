# Your Client's Websites (v2)

After registering on your network, your customers can access their dashboard.

Besides the [Account](https://help.wpultimo.com/article/411-the-account-page-v2) page, where they can see important information regarding their payments, memberships, domains, plan limitations and more, they also have access to the **My Sites** page, where they can see and manage all their websites. All they have to do is to click on My Sites on their dashboard.

They will be shown all their websites, with a **Manage** button right below each one of them. If they click on it, they will be redirected to the **dashboard of this specific website**.

They can also see which one of their websites is the **primary** one for plans that allow them to have more than one website.
