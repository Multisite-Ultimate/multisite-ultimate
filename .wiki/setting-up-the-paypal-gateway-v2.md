# Setting Up The PayPal Gateway (v2)

_**IMPORTANT NOTE: This article refers to WP Ultimo version 2.x.**_

You can activate up to four methods of payment on our payment settings page: Stripe, Stripe Checkout, PayPal and Manual. In this article, we will see how to integrate with **PayPal**.

Just like Stripe, PayPal is widely used for online payments, especially on WordPress websites. This article will guide you on how to use PayPal as a payment method available on your network.

Note that you need to have a **PayPal Business account** to obtain the API credential needed for this integration.

## Enabling PayPal on your network

To enable PayPal as an available payment method on your network, go to **WP Ultimo > Settings > Payments** tab and tick the box next to PayPal.

## Getting the PayPal API credentials

Once PayPal is enabled as a payment gateway, you will need to populate the fields for PayPal API **Username** , PayPal API **Password** and PayPal API **Signature**.

You can get this by logging in to your PayPal [Live](https://www.paypal.com/home) or [Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/home) account.

(Remember that you can use the **sandbox mode** to test payments and see if the gateway is correctly setup. Just toggle on the correspondent section.)

To request API Signature or Certificate credentials for your PayPal account:

  1. Go to your [Account Settings](https://www.paypal.com/businessmanage/account/accountAccess).

  2. In the **API access** section, click **Update**.

     * If you have already generated an API Signature or Certificate, you will be redirected to a page where you can find your credentials.

     * _**Note:** If you are prompted to verify your PayPal account, then follow the on-screen instructions._

  4. Select _one_ of the following options, then click **Agree and Submit**.

     * **Request API Signature** – Select for API Signature authentication.

     * **Request API Certificate** – Select for API Certificate authentication.

  5. PayPal generates your API credentials as follows:

     * **API Signature credentials** include an API Username, API Password, and Signature, which does not expire. These values are hidden by default for added security. Click **Show/Hide** to toggle them on and off. When finished, click **Done**.

     * **API Certificate credentials** include an API Username, API Password, and Certificate, which expires automatically after three years. Click **Download Certificate** to save the API Certificate to your desktop.

That’s it, your PayPal payment integration is complete!
