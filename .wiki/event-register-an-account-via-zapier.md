# Event: Register an account via Zapier

In the article [Integrating WP Multisite WaaS with Zapier](1677127282-integrating-wp-ultimo-with-zapier.html), we discussed how to use Zapier to perform different actions within WP Multisite WaaS based on triggers and events. In this article, we will show how you can integrate 3rd party applications. We will use Google Sheets as the source of data and send the information to WP Multisite WaaS to register an account.

First, you need to create a **Google Sheet** under your Google Drive. Make sure you properly define each column so that you can easily map the data later.

Under **"Set up trigger** ", you will need to select and specify the google spreadsheet and worksheet you will use where the data will be coming from. Just go ahead and fill those out and hit "**Continue** "
