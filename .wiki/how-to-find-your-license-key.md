# How to find your license key

License keys are necessary to activate your plugin and to grant you support.

Currently, we have three license formats working with WP Ultimo:

  * The Freemius license key: sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

  * The Gumroad license key: XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX

  * The CodeCanyon license key: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

Gumroad and CodeCanyon licenses are the old ones. Therefore, we strongly recommend you convert your key to the Freemius model if you have one of those. You can [ask for the conversion here](https://wpultimo.com/convert-your-license/).

# Finding your license key

## Freemius

If you purchased WP Ultimo via Freemius, you should have received an email with your license key, some purchase details, and a download link.
