## System emails

System emails in WP Multisite WaaS are those **automatic notifications** sent by the system after certain actions like registration, payment, domain mapping, etc. These emails can be edited or modified from WP Multisite WaaS settings. It also comes with a feature that will allow you to reset and import existing settings from another WP Multisite WaaS installation.

### Resetting & Importing

New WP Multisite WaaS versions, as well as add-ons, can and will register new emails from time to time.

To prevent conflicts and other issues, **we won't add the new email templates as System Emails on your install automatically** , unless they are crucial to the correct functioning of a given feature.

However, super admins and agents can import this newly registered emails via the importer tool. That process will create a new system email with the content and configuration of the new email template, allowing the super admin to make any modifications they want or keep them as is.

#### How to import system emails

Go to your WP Multisite WaaS Settings page and head to the **Emails** tab.

#### Reseting System Emails

Other times, you'll realize that the changes you made to a given email template are not working for you anymore and you'd like to reset it to their **default state**.

In such cases, you have two options: you can simply delete the system email and import it back (using the instructions above) - which will erase send metrics and other things, which makes this method least preferred.

Or you can use the **Reset & Import tool** to reset that email template.

To reset an email template, you can follow the steps above until you reach the Reset & Import tool, and then, toggle the **Reset** option and select the emails you want to reset back to their default content.
