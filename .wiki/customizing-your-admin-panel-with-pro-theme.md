# Customizing your Admin Panel with PRO Theme

Often when doing client work we get the need to provide our clients with a custom experience in the admin dashboard of WordPress. If you are searching for a more professional look and feel, PRO Theme might help you.

PRO Theme is an admin theme developed to help you when customizing your clients’ Dashboard. And it’s also part of WP Ultimo’s premium plugins core.

After installing it, go to your _Plugins_ page and click to activate it on your Network.

_**NOTE:**_ _If you just install it, it will show on your client’s as an option that can be marked to add the theme only to that user._

Now, you have your admin interface completely redesigned! You also have a new menu on the left column called PRO Theme.
