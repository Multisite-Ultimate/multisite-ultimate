Click the arrow on the right to open a side window. Then, you should select the option that will cancel the **auto-renew**.

The system will show you a confirmation message.

If you are sure you want to cancel your subscription, just click the _**Cancel Renewals**_ button. After this action, you will be asked to answer a quick survey.

Done! Your subscription won't be automatically renewed.

**You will have a valid key until your subscription expires**. In case you want to reactivate your subscription, you will need to do it manually.
