# Managing Payments and Invoices

Manage payments in WP Multisite WaaS is as easy as it gets. You can set the auto-renew, allow trials and configure invoices. In version 2.0 you can set different payment gateways to fulfill your customers needs. Currently, you can enable payments via Stripe, Stripe Checkout, PayPal or receive manually.

## General Payment Settings

To access your payment settings go to your WP Multisite WaaS Settings page and navigate to the Payments tab.

There you will find the general options to your payments management.  
The options affect how prices are displayed on the frontend, the backend and in reports.

**Force Auto-Renew:** Toggle this option to create new memberships with auto-renew activated (if the gateway supports it) or deactivated. When deactivated an auto-renew option will be shown during checkout.

**Allow Trials without Payment Method:** Enable this option to only ask for a payment method when the trial period is over.

**Send Invoice on Payment Confirmation:** Enabling this option will attach a PDF invoice (marked paid) with the payment confirmation email.

**Invoice Numbering Scheme:** Decide what kind of numbering scheme should be used on the invoices. You can choose between Payment Code or Sequential Number. If you choose the last option, define the next invoice number and the invoice number prefix.

## Enabling Payment Gateways

You can activate up to four methods of payment on our payment settings page: Stripe, Stripe Checkout, PayPal and Manual.

**Stripe:** Toggle this option to activate Stripe payment. Fill the blanks with the Stripe Publishable and Secret Key and save. This method will show a space to insert the credit card number during the checkout.

**Stripe Checkout:** Toggle this option to activate Stripe Checkout payment. Fill the blanks with the Stripe Publishable and Secret Key and save. This method will redirect the customer to a Stripe Checkout page during the checkout.

**PayPal:** Toggle this option to activate PayPal as a payment method. Fill the blanks with PayPal credentials that you can get in your PayPal account dashboard. This method will redirect the customer to a PayPal payment page during the checkout.

### Confirming manual payments

To confirm a manual payment, go to the Payments menu on the left bar. There you can see all the payments on your network and their details, including their status. A manual payment will always have a Pending status until you manually change it.

Enter the payment page by clicking the reference code. On this page you have all the details of the pending payment, such as reference ID, products, timestamps and more.

On the right column, you can alter the status of the payment. Changing it to Completed and toggling the Activate Membership option will enable your customer’s site and their membership will be active.
