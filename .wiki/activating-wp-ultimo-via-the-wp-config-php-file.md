# Activating WP Ultimo via the wp-config.php File

Since version 1.7.3, WP Ultimo can be activated directly via the wp-config.php file. To do that, you’ll need to place your license code inside the wp-config.php file, by pasting the following snippet above the  
_/* That’s all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */_

define('WP_ULTIMO_LICENSE_KEY', 'Your License Code Here');

Remember to replace the “ _Your License Code Here_ ” part with your actual license code which you received alongside the plugin file when you purchased your license.
