## **How does WP Ultimo’s affiliate program work?**

If you become a WP Ultimo affiliate you will have a referral URL to sell WP Ultimo on your website, page or other social network.

Each sale made through this link gives you a 20% commission on the license value.

Once you reach the 100,00 US Dollars threshold you are able to receive your affiliate payment.

By default, it happens every 10th day each month, if you reach the threshold.
