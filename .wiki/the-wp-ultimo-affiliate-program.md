## **How does Multisite Ultimate’s affiliate program work?**

If you become a Multisite Ultimate affiliate you will have a referral URL to sell Multisite Ultimate on your website, page or other social network.

Each sale made through this link gives you a 20% commission on the license value.

Once you reach the 100,00 US Dollars threshold you are able to receive your affiliate payment.

By default, it happens every 10th day each month, if you reach the threshold.
