# Understanding the WP Multisite WaaS Dashboard

Before we immerse ourselves in more advanced configuration options and the operational aspects of WP Multisite WaaS let us take a look at the dashboard.

Like many WordPress plugins, WP Multisite WaaS creates a network-level menu entry titled ‘WP Multisite WaaS’ with a number of children entries underneath.

## Network Dashboard Widgets

WP Multisite WaaS injects a few useful widgets into the network-level dashboard. This dashboard is found by navigating to My Sites > Network Admin > Dashboard. The widgets are designed to provide easy access to information and common operations for the network administrator.

### First Steps

## WP Multisite WaaS Dashboard

Where the network-level dashboard presents holistic information about the network the WP Multisite WaaS dashboard located at the top-level of the WP Multisite WaaS menu presents information about the service.

## Welcome Tour

On a fresh installation of WP Multisite WaaS a brief welcome tour is displayed familiarizing the network administrator with the dashboard and its new functions. Customers of WP Multisite WaaS 1.x will notice the dashboard as a new addition as well as more intuitive navigation and options.

### Documentation

At the top of the dashboard lies the ‘Documentation’ link. The documentation (this documentation) contains a wealth of information regarding the installation, operation, support, and maintenance of WP Multisite WaaS as well as ancillary information designed to be helpful to the network administrator.

The documentation link is prevalent on most WP Multisite WaaS pages providing contextual help when called upon. Thus when working with sites, for example, the documentation link will provide help related to the creation and management of network sites.

### Monthly Recurring Revenue Growth

Leading from the network-level widget the MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) displays a monthly breakdown of revenue over a 12-month calendar period.

New revenue is tracked in blue color while cancellations are reflected in red color.

### Date-range Support

Depending on the number of customers, activity, and type of information statistics soon become overwhelming, difficult to find, and difficult to interpret.

The date-range support built into the dashboard allows the network administrator to focus on only the information and information period required.
