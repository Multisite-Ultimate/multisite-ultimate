# Known incompatibilities with other Plugins

After installing and activating Multisite Ultimate, you might run into issues due to unaddressed incompatibilities with other plugins.

We are actively working to reduce this list with each and every new release, but if a plugin is listed here, you might need to deactivate it in order to have a fully functional Multisite Ultimate Network.

Here is a list of them and what you should do in these cases:

**Some WPMU DEV plugins** Some of the plugins _no longer_ maintained by WPMU DEV are known to cause the Multisite Ultimate registration flow to halt on the last step (the user isn't able to create an account). Here's a list of the plugins that cause those issues:

  * Signup Language: _Multisite Ultimate has an add-on that offers the same functionality, called Multisite Ultimate: Language Switcher._

  * Set Blog Description on Blog Creation: _This is built into Multisite Ultimate, so there's no need for an extra plugin._

  * New Blog Templates: _This is built into Multisite Ultimate, so there's no need for an extra plugin._

  * Set Password on Multisite Blog Creation: _This is built into Multisite Ultimate, so there's no need for an extra plugin._

  * Signup TOS: _This is built into Multisite Ultimate, so there's no need for an extra plugin._

  * Anti-Splog: Although less powerful, this is also _built into Multisite Ultimate._

**Note** : All other WPMU Dev plugins can be used normally alongside Multisite Ultimate. Examples include _Smush_ , _Forminator_ , _Defender,_ etc.
