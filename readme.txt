The Complete Network Solution for transforming your WordPress Multisite into a Website as a Service (WaaS) platform.

== Description ==

**Ultimate Multisite** turns your WordPress Multisite into a full WaaS (Website as a Service) platform—so you can sell plans, provision new sites from templates, map custom domains, and manage customers and billing with confidence.

Launch niche site builders, productized services, or large, branded networks without stitching together dozens of tools. From checkout to provisioning to ongoing management, Ultimate Multisite gives you the building blocks to create a modern, scalable website platform on top of WordPress.

Formerly known as WP Ultimo, now community‑maintained and actively improved.
