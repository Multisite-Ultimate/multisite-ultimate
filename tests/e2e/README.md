## Start development and test environment

Run `npm run env:start` to start both environments.

- [Development environment on port 8888](http://localhost:8888)
- [Testing environment on port 8889](http://localhost:8889)

## Running Tests

### Open Cypress UI

Development environment
```
npm run cy:open:dev
```

Testing environment
```
npm run cy:open:test
```

This will launch the Cypress Test Runner where you can run tests interactively.

### Run Cypress Tests Headlessly

Development environment
```
npm run cy:run:dev
```

Testing environment
```
npm run cy:run:test
```

Runs all Cypress tests in the CLI, useful for testing locally and CI/CD environments.

## Destroy all environments

To destroy all environments manually:
```
npm run env:destroy
```

## Configuration

Modify `.wp-env.json` in the root of the project to point to custom themes or plugins for testing.
